Introduction
The project entails having a caterer as the site administrator and can add meals to the application as well as set menus for a particular day. The customers, after signing up first, are then allowed to book meals online.

The Client Side
This is the frontend part of the application and will involve building from the ground up a user interface without the use of UI frontend frameworks such as Bootstrap or Foundation.

The color palette was generated using coolors.co which is a tool for generating non-crashing colors.

The wireframes are built using wireframe.cc.
